# PawNav

PawNav is a mobile application focused on lost animals, found animals, and adoption posts.  
Its purpose is to help people share information clearly and reach others who are actually relevant.

The application is not designed as a social media platform.  
Posts exist to solve a problem, not to compete for attention.

## What PawNav Does

Users can create posts for animals that are lost, found, or available for adoption.  
Posts are tied to location and category so information stays contextual.  
Users can contact each other directly when a post is relevant to them.

## Core Features

• Location based animal posts  
• Clear post categories  
• Direct messaging between users  
• Push notifications  

## Demo Video
